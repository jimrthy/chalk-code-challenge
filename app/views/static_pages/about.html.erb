<h1>What's Going On?</h1>
<p>I was asked to do a simple sample Ruby on Rails site
as part of a job screening. Part of the instructions included
"Be creative and have fun." So I'm using the excuse to explore
some technologies that have been on back-burner parts of
my todo list for months now.</p>

<p>Odds are, there isn't anything interesting in the site at
all. You certainly shouldn't take its opinions seriously.
The actual web site should never be considered anything more
than an amusement piece.</p>
